### Domain1 Design for Organizational Complexity

**AWS Firewall Manager manages:**

- Route53 Resolver Dns, WAF,Shield Advanced, network firewall, Security groups

Integrating another business unit IT assets hosted on AWS into your current hub-and-spoke network architecture using AWS Transit Gateway is a great approach. It provides a centralized way to manage connectivity between different VPC,VPN, and direct conect, without plethora of peering connections.


Secure multi-account environment.

AWS Landing Zone provides a standarized and secure foundation for managing multiple AWS accounts with predefined configurations and best practices.

On-demand capacity reservation is the prefer option for a event that occurss
only one in the year.

Using Consolidated Billing for a single account and link all the other various accounts in the organization. Ensure that Reserved Instance Sharing is turned on. The discounts for specific instances will automatically be applied to the consolidated service.

For a specific scenario where: The application is fronted by a Network Load Balancer and has an EC2 auto scaled web tier with a backend Auora Mysql database.
No public connectivity has been configured for this VPC. Unfortunately you just have found out that this application is hosted in a VPC with the same IP addreses range as the application in your environment requiring the connectivity.


Create a privateLink endpoint service in the VPC which hosts the application. Use AWS PrivateLink Endpoint in the VPC subnets, which requires access to the application.



### Domain 2: Design for new Solutions

Your client is a software company starting their initial architecture steps for their new multitenant CRM application. They are concerned about responsiveness for companies with employee scattered around the globe. What ideas could you share to help with the overall latency of the application ?


Install key parts of the application in multiple AWS Region chosen to balance latency for geographically diverse users. Use Lambda@Edge to dynamically select the appropiate Region based on the user's location.


The cloudfront already have a configuration of HTTP ONLY, but the origin which are webserver has redirection from HTTP TO HTTPS, this create a infinite loop, and you should change the clodufront to allow HTTPS, on the redirection configured on the webserver. Enable cookie forwarding and query string is unnecesary.

If you have 1 TB in dynamoDB, and see a perfomance issue one possible solution will be backup and create new table because: 
	As a Dynamo table grows, it will split into more partitions. If the RCU and WCU remain constant, they are divided equally across the partitions. 


For a backup with ORACLE RDS
 you can use Oracle Data Pump
 Oracle export/ import utitilies
 Oracle Recovery Manager
 RDS Snapshot and point-in-time recovery

For a use case when you need to migrate to lambda your java application and you reach the maximum size Limit. 

Consider containerization or deploying using Beanstalk
Using the NFS for a shared filesystem

Configure ephermeral storage in Lambda console to permit a larger codebase to be deployed.
Lambda allow an increase in temporary file storage to 10GB.

Requester Interrogation feature on Cloudfront is used to identify the device used by the requester. 

TCP SYN Flood is protected automatically by AWS SHIELD standard. 

For EMR cluster, the task node do no store any HDFS data. Task node storage is considered ephemeral.

For a scenario: The RTO is defined as four hours and RPO have been defined as five minutes.

Configure RDS Read Replica to use cross-region replication from the primary to a backup region.

Setup cross-region replication for s3 buckets.

User case: You have been asked to design a landscape that can facilite the upload of very high-resolution photos from mobile devices,gather metadata on objects, and store metadata for analysis.

Is not recommended to use Kinesis because has a limit on the inbound object.

Using this scenario: One service handles a decryption activity using a CMK stored in AWS KMS. To meet very strict audit requirements, you must demostrate that you are following the Principle of Least Privileges dynamically.

You should use Grant in KMS.

Policy evaluation

- Authentication: AWS first authenticate the principal that make the request. If necessary.
- Processing the request context. AWS processes the information gathered in the request to determine which policies apply to the request.
- Evaluating policies within a single account
- Determine whether a request is allowed or denied within an account.

### Domain 3: Continous Improvement for Existing Solutions
